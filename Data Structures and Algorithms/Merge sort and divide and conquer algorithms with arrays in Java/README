The WordList Java file mainly consists of code in order to do things efficiently with arrays.
Things such as: creating the array, sorting the array, inserting into an array, deleting from an array, removing duplicates within
an array, finding the index that belongs to an input string within an array, and creating a subarray from the original
array are all done relatively efficiently (based off the divide and conquer algorithm/model)
